# custom-css3-scrollbar
Pure CSS scrollbar with options to change the layout and color.

The `scrollbar` set of CSS properties is a proprietary style hook from Internet Explorer 5.5, which let designers create custom themes for the browser's native scrollbars. Currently, it is exposed behind the `-webkit` vendor prefix for use in browsers using the Webkit (and Blink) rendering engine.

Otherwise if you want to jump straight in and start using the CSS simply copy and paste it into your css file.
